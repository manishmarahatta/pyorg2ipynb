ipython notebook is cool, but when you start tracking it in git,
life becomes the hell, life it become unbearable to look at the
code diff off everchanging json.

If you say ipython/jupyter notebook can import/export the python code
file then you must be kidding. Import keeps everything in one cell,
in export you lose all your precious markdown note, and here I'm
creating this convertor.
